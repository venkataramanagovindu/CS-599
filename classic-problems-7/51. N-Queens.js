Explain your approach in 3-5 steps:
Explanation: 
1. start by initializing an empty board of size n x n, where all cells are initially filled with '.'. This will be used to track the positions of the queens.
2. use a recursive backtracking function to attempt placing queens in each row. 
   For each row,  try placing a queen in each column and check if itâ€™s a valid move (no other queen is on the same column or diagonal).
3. When a queen is placed in every row (row === n), the current board configuration is added to the result list. 
4. After attempting to place a queen in a position and recursing, backtrack by removing the queen and trying the next column in the current row.
Time Complexity (in terms of N):
With bruteforce it will be O(N ^ N) if we consider all possible placements of queens in an N x N board.
However, with backtracking, the average case is significantly reduced as many configurations are pruned early. O(N!)

Space Complexity (in terms of N):
O(N*N) As we are storing the board configuration in a 2D array and the recursion stack will also take O(N * N) space.
