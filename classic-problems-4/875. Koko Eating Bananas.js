Explain your approach in 3-5 steps:
Explanation: 
1. Initialize search range from 1 to max(piles).
2. Apply binary search, calculating mid as the eating speed.
3. Compute total hours (curr_h) needed for mid speed.
4. If curr_h â‰¤ h, update result and search left; else, search right.
5. Return result, the minimum speed to finish in h hours. 


Time Complexity (in terms of N):
(Time Complexity: O(n log M), where M is the maximum number of bananas in a pile.

Space Complexity (in terms of N):
O(1) we are not using any extra space.
