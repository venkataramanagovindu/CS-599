Any problem you faced while coding this:
    Example: Yes, sorting of .....

Time Complexity (in terms of N):
   Example: O(N log N) - Sorting the array takes O(N log N) time, and the two-pointer traversal takes O(N) time.

Space Complexity (in terms of N):
    Example: O(N) - The space used for storing the pairs (values and indices) in `newArr` is O(N).
