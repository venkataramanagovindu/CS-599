Explain your approach in 3-5 steps:
Explanation: 
1. Maintain counts of $5 and $10 bills to track available change.
2. For a $5 bill, no change is neededâ€”just increment the count of $5 bills.
3. For a $10 bill, check if a $5 bill is available for change; if so, decrement $5 and increment $10.
4. For a $20 bill, prefer giving change as one $10 and one $5; if not possible, check for three $5 bills.
5. If at any point the required change can't be given, return false; otherwise, return true after processing all bills.

Time Complexity (in terms of N):
O(N): We iterate through the list of bills once, where N is the number of bills.

Space Complexity (in terms of N):
O(1): We use a constant amount of space to keep track of the counts of $5 and $10 bills, regardless of the input size.
